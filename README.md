# Java-String-Manipulation-Demo
Java String Manipulation Demo
=============================

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates various string manipulation operations, including:

* Case insensitivity using `equalsIgnoreCase()`
* String conversion to lower and upper case using `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`
* Reference equality using the `==` operator
* Primitive equality using the `==` operator
* Object equality using the `equals()` method
* String operations such as `endsWith()` and `contains()`
* Integer conversion to octal using `Integer.toOctalString()`

The program is designed to illustrate the differences between these operations and provide a clear understanding of how they work in Java.

**Running the Program**

To run the program, simply compile and execute the `StringManipulationDemo.java` file.

**Output**

The program will output the results of each operation, demonstrating the expected behavior of each method.
